### Project Motivation
superstratum to enable communication between people who spoke a mix of different languages. The language serves as the working language of Ethiopia and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system. However Amharic has a very small publically available corpus for downstream natural language tasks. As such different NLP tasks are considerably difficult for such under-resourced languages.
